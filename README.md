# Redux Notes Frontend

This is a practice project using React + Redux
This is a remake of the frontend of the full stack web app located in https://github.com/VendeM0us/notes_app

The main purpose of this app is to use redux as the main state management and to learn about the "flux architecture". Tests are written for reducers in order to check their functionality.
